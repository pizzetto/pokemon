# Pokemon List Sample app
An Android Appication that show a list of Pokemon from PokeAPI

## Notes
I have created two different app flows, one that uses Paging3 library and remote mediator. This flow 
does not allows users to filter Pokemons by type 

The secondo flow download all data at once before displaying the Pokemon list in order to let the 
user search even by Pokemon type.
Here is also used a custom paginator
